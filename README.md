# Made With [Smile](https://github.com/vitorbetmann/smile)

#### Recreated classic games in C to deepen understanding of low-level programming and game architecture, triggering the development of the Smile library.
#### Shoutout to [CS50's Introduction to Game Development](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/) for the great lessons and game assets.
#### All games are made with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com) for rendering, sound, and input-gathering.
