## Notes:

- Uses Smile's SceneManager.
- Built a custom queue to manage pipes with a O(1) enqueue and dequeue operations.
- Applied tracked iteration optimization so the Bird only checks collision with the next pipe, reducing per-frame computation.

## Learning outcomes:

• C: Function Pointers; More about memory management;

• Game Dev: More on State Machines.
